# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## First step

run `npm install` to set up all the dependencies needed for the project.

## Second step

run `npm start` to lauch the app.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## How about this test? Components hierarchy?

Before reading this, I hope you enjoyed this little app :) 

Regarding the components hierarchy, you'll find a WelcomePage component, two components related to the login part (LoginFeatures.jsx and Login.jsx), two components related to the cities search, history list and autocomplete (SearchFeatures.jsx and Search.jsx), and one for the Leaflet Map with the markers (Map.jsx).

In the styles folder, you'll find all the files used to style the app. I've intentionally used CSS and Styled Components just so you know I can work with both.

## Difficulties I've encountered ? 

The main difficulty was to do this test while following my fulltime training, I barely had free time to make this app but I am pround of myself :)
Regarding the features, the bounding map is the missing part. I've tried to do it (you'll find the comments at the end of the Map.jsx component).
